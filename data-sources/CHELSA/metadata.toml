CHELSA v2.1 (Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas) dataset,
providing high-resolution climate data for the 1981â€“2010 period. This dataset includes
bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and precipitation values, along with
indicators of frost and growing degree days. The data reflects long-term climatological
averages rather than temporal variations within the period.

For further details, see the CHELSA technical specifications:
